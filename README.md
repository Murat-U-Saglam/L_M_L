# Learning Machine Learning

The aim is to be exposed to ML models using PyTorch and experiment with basic implementations.

## Directory Structure

- Supervised
  - NumerAI
    - Is a hedgefund that supplies features and targets to train models on
    - Tried this since it is a larger dataset and I get to experiment with trees and also build data pipelines
  - Dogs-Cats
    - Basic CNN - Tried this to get exposure for images and classification
- Unsupervised
  - HeartAttack
    - For more data analysis purposes and clustering
- Reinforcement
  - Not implemented yet
- APP
  - Cifar10
    - Creating a basic web app to get images and classify them
  - RealtimeObjectDetection
    - Self-explanatory

## Future developments
- [ ] Make all models work with GPU training
- [ ] Get 90> Accuracy on CNN
- [ ] Do some more investigatory stuff on the clustering
- [ ] Build reinforcement learning section
- [ ] Potentially in different repo - Work on NumerAI more thoroughly

## Learn the theory
